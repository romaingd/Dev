# Manage your code project - Project briefs


## What is a project brief?

A **project brief**, or **roadmap**, is a way to identify project goals, plan its development, and take into account aspects like a budget or timeline.

**Most project briefs include:**
* Summary
* Stakeholders
* Goals
* Timeline
* Budget

## Write the summary, stakeholders, and goals sections of a project brief

### Summary

A place where everyone can look to get a quick idea of the project without looking at the whole brief.

> This project intends to provide a functional Dough subscription service. The purpose of this service is to allow Dough customers to repeatedly order their favorite ingredient sets, without bothering with choosing them in a list over and over again. We anticipate that this will increase Customer Lifetime for regular users.


### Stakeholders

The people directly involved in the project. This could be developers or designers, product managers, marketers, third-party collaborators.

> This project will involve the following stakeholders:
> * Karin, iOS developer
> * Miles, Android developer
> * Joanna, desktop developer
> * Phil, Chief Financial Officer
> * Amin, lead designer
> * Lea, product manager
> * Oksanna, quality assurance manager
> * Hugh, marketer


### Goals

Goals should be **specific**, **measurable** and **agreed-upon**.

> The goals of this project are:
> * Release a rigorously tested cross-platform subscription service that allows users to save ingredient sets
> * Make sure that this subscription feature is aligned with the main service in terms of design, functionality and content
> * Performance goal: have 10% of Dough customer sign up for new Dough subscriptions in the first 6 months

## Write the timeline and budget sections of a project brief

### Timeline

Start by writing down the big steps, then break them down to individual substeps. **Associate each with a worst-case deadline, even if it's a rough estimate**.

|              Steps             | Substeps | Duration | Date |
| :----------------------------: | :------: | :------: | ---- |
| Set Dough subscription pricing | Finance team reasearches subscription options and budget | 1 week | November 1 |
| | Have meeting with finance team and CEO | 1 hour | November 7 |
| | Email payments processor with list of needs | 2 hours | November 7 |
| | Allow 2 weeks of response time from payment processor for final quote | 2 weeks | November 21 |


### Budget

The budget should consist in two types of expenses:
* **Core costs** (should be estimated using available information, past experience and projects):
  * Salaries (in-house collaborators)
  * Rates (freelance collaborators)
  * Travel costs
  * Physical materials (computer, supplies)
  * Services (web hosting, domain name, software tools, etc)
  * Backup budget for unforeseen events
* **Sneaky expenses** (smaller costs that silently accumulate):
  * Postage and shipping
  * Licenses
  * Recruitment
  * Promotional material
  * Phone bills
