Hi and welcome, thank you for your correction that you will bring to my exercise.
as expected, below, the different links.

- Link to the main CodePen document that features HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: 
	https://codepen.io/Menders/pen/PxggQK

- Link to the separate JSON CodePen document that includes album JSON in the JS section:
	https://codepen.io/Menders/pen/jQRRzv.js

- Link to the separate HTML CodePen document that includes the HTML of the page's album section:
	https://codepen.io/Menders/pen/QJXwvq?editors=1010


NB: 

You can give me the rating of 0, I understand you. That's it, the fact is that the link between the disc albums page and the JSON file works pretty well. But when I load this page via ajax when I click on the "Album" button, the page loads but the JSON content does not load.

Help please, give me 0 if you want but explain me what is needed to solve the problem.

Thank you in advance !
