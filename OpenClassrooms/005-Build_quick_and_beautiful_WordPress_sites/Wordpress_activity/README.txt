===== Summary of changes =====

I chose the "Feedly blog" theme by searching for "blog" themes, and selecting a simple one that appeared on top. I changed the footer background color (from black to deep purple) using the "footer settings" section of the theme customizer. I added a tagline "Just like Cat Avalanche, but different", using the "site identity" section of the theme customizer. I added a logo using the same section. I added the upper menu using the "menus" section of the theme customizer. I inserted contact info by adding a text widget to footer widget area 4, in the "widgets" section of the theme customizer. I also added the calendar widget to the sidebar widget area in the same section. In the "Homepage settings" section of the theme customizer, I changed the posts page to avoid displaying the "Blog" page in a specific format. In the additional CSS area, I added the following lines to produce a light cyan background color to the site's content (not the best color harmony, I give you that), accounting for a modification of the theme's CSS:

.site-content {
	background-color: lightcyan;
}
