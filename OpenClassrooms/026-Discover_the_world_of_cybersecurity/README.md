# Discover the world of cybersecurity

## The explosion of cybersecurity incidents

In the 90's and early 2000's, cybersecurity was basically and mostly:
* **Installing an antivirus** to prevent viruses from deleting a computer's files
* **Installing a firewall** to disable unauthorized communication on the Internet by blocking some ports


Today (late 2010's), the online world is much more complex because of its **hyperconnection**. Cyberattacks are no longer limited to destructive viruses, and can take various shapes including:
* **Data breaches** (e.g. passwords, personal data)
* **Ransomwares** - encrypting files with a key that can only be retrieved by paying a ransom
* **Infrastructure threatening** (e.g. in Ukraine, where a cyberattack on energy plants resulted in power loss for thousands of people)


Cyber risks can be grouped in 4 categories:
* **Cybercriminality** - typically for money
* **Image damaging** - typically to discredit someone
* **Espionage**
* **Sabotage**

## Sony example - All emails made public

On November 24th, 2014, a hacker group named the *Guardians of Peace* **leak a huge amount of confidential data from Sony**:
* Employees personal data
* Email exchanges
* Movies not yet released
* Finally, a lot of data on Sony servers got deleted

Although there's been no definite proof to date despite a FBI investigation, suspicions are directed towards North Korea, related to the release of the movie [*The Interview*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Interview).

This attack had a massive, and probably unprecedented, impact on Sony. Emptied servers, financial loss, but more importantly email leaks have tarnished for a long time the image of the company and some employees. Sony has tried, in vain, preventing the diffusion of leaked data, but couldn't stop it from being available on Wikileaks.

Lesson for the future: **no recorded data is confidential**.

## Equifax example - Personal data leak

Equifax is a private American agency that gives credit scores to individuals. In may 2017, Equifax was victim of a massive cyberattack that resulted in a **leak of millions of Americans' personal data**, including names, postal addresses, birthdates, driving license numbers, credit card numbers... 150 million Americans were directly concerned.

But the most damage was caused by the leak of social security numbers, because it is considered by Americans as a private identifier, and used to open a bank account, ask for a credit or report taxes.

Beyond the attack itself, the crisis is noticeable for its management by Equifax:
* The attack was discovered 2.5 months later
* The public was informed only 5 weeks later, i.e. almost 4 months after the attack
* The company managers sold their shares inbetween
* The importance of the attack was minimized by the company


Lessons for the future:
* **Update all softwares**
* **Crisis management matters**
* Some parts of the society have to be reorganized for more security

## WannaCry example - Hospitals paralyzed by a ransomware

In may 2017, a worldwide wave of cyberattacks paralyzes a number of computers, in particular those used in UK's hospitals. A ransomware named WannaCry encrypted all files on the computer, and asked for a ransom to "unlock" the computer.

WannaCry exploits a Windows XP breach that was discovered by the NSA (and leaked after an attack); unpatched systems are vulnerable. Hospitals, in UK and France, that used old XP systems while never updating them, were the most notable victim of the attack, that concerned patient health data.

Some hospitals tried paying the ransom, in despair. This was not recommended by security agencies, since data recovery was not guaranteed in any way, and payment methods could be compromised.

Lessons for the future:
* **Update everything**
* **Security incidents can trigger security incidents**
* **Consequences are real**

## Attack means

### Software vulnerabilities

All softwares have vulnerabilities (*error humanum est*).

Protection: **Update all softwares as frequently as possible**


### Network vulnerabilities

Unsecure wi-fi, connections, unencrypted authentification data in cookies, servers and routers with default passwords, ...

Protection: **Strong encryption, never leave default configuration**


## Access rights

When access rights are considered a pain and an obstacle, it is tempting to give admin rights to everyone, or write down passwords. On the other extermity, giving full rights to only one person does not pass the bus factor test.

Protection: **Give access rights correctly to each individual, no more, no less**


## Social engineering

People are very much vulnerable to attacks (and can't be patched). Techniques like **phishing** or imitating managers on the phone can be used to prompt someone to send their password in clear. If phishing was easily identifiable yesterday, it is no longer today (**spearphishing**).

Protection: **Inform and train individuals**
