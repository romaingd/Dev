===== Suggestions to improve the website =====

* Overall, the appearance on mobile devices looks pretty good, so no need
to do anything on this point. Tested on Galaxy S5 and most iPhone versions.

* The website takes a very long time to fully load: 2.5 seconds for the main 
part, plus resources that are periodically fetched (see loading_screenshot.txt)
It is very likely possible to reduce this loading time in order to keep more
users connected and to fluidify the experience. This is true for online
(no throttling) settings; it is even more important for slower connection
speeds, where the website takes an unacceptable amount of time to load.

* The website does not use HTTPS, which is recommended even for sites that 
don't handle sensitive data. To quote Chrome's DevTools, "HTTPS prevents
intruders from tampering with or passively listening in on the communications
between your app and your users, and is a prerequisite for HTTP/2 and many new
web platform APIs". Switching to HTTPS would be an important security
improvement.

* Using cache more efficiently. The audits run detected almost 100 static
resources that could be cached more efficiently in order to speed up repeated
visits on the page. This should obviously be balanced with the cost of caching
many resources.

* Improving the accessibility of the website. This means including `alt` 
attributes in all images, structuring the elements in a consistent fashion and
making sure they describe sufficiently well the associated contents, etc. The
current state is pretty good already in this regard.

* Following best practices. This includes for example avoiding 
`document.write()` to dynamically load external scripts (delaying the total
loading time).
