# Manage your code project - Agile and Waterfall



## Apply agile principles to your software development

* An agile team is **fast, responsive** and **collaborative**

* According to the **Manifesto for Agile Software Development**, the agile practice puts:
  * **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
  * **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
  * **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
  * **Responding to change** over following a plan
    * Quick iterations
    * Ship it!
    * Work in sprints

* Pushing the agile ideas to the limit, we reach **Extreme Programming**, that relies for example on constant pair programming, unit testing of all code, frequent iterations, and no time spent on features until they are actually needed.

## The best known agile framework: Scrum

* The main basis of a Scrum team workflow is a **sprint**. It lasts 2 or 4 weeks, and defines a set of features that should be **coded and tested** at the end of the sprint. This encourages small, quick iterations.

* A scrum team is organized in roles:
  * The **Scrum Master** (the ship's engineer) keeps an eye on all aspects of the project (coding, testing, organization, human) to help with tools where it is needed (e.g. whiteboard if the schedule is constantly ignored)
  * The **product owner** (the ship's captain) manages the product itself, via the **backlog** (ops-view of projects to advance or in progress) and the **roadmap** (strategic-view of projects and releases company-wise). The PO writes **user stories** (like "As a X user, I want Y so that Z") to prioritize the backlog.
  * The **team** (the ship itself) should be **cross-functional**, i.e. each member should be able to help as needed across specialties.

## The Waterfall model of project management

* It imitates actual waterfall in the following sense:
  * Projects cascade through different phases
  * The flow between each phase should be logical and natural
  * You can see the end from the beginning of the project
  * Projects don't flow backwards

* It follows the following steps (plan carefully first, execute faithfully then):
  * **Requirements and analysis** - get everything in place
  * **Design** - design the architecture using an overall view of the software system
  * **Coding**
  * **Testing** - unit tests and integration tests
  * **Installation and release**
  * **Maintenance**
