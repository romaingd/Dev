# Why learn how to learn?

## My reasons

* It is a course that is included in the "Full-stack developer" path of OpenClassrooms.

* I already learned a lot how to learn. Maybe there are better or more advanced techniques out there.

* I'm curious to see whether using "organization helpers" such as bullet lists is said to really help a lot the learning process.

* I want to see if I can complete this course quickly while absorbing it appropriately.
