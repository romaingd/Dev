# Learning how to learn - Notes

## Prepare yourself to learn

### Why learn how to learn?

* It is a course that is included in the "Full-stack developer" path of OpenClassrooms.
* I already learned a lot how to learn. Maybe there are better or more advanced techniques out there.
* I'm curious to see whether using "organization helpers" such as bullet lists is said to really help a lot the learning process.
* I want to see if I can complete this course quickly while absorbing it appropriately.

### Explore your various intelligence and learning styles

Here are:

* Eight methods that I know are **most effective** for me:
    * (P) Learn by studying books or other print resources
    * (S) Learn by asking someone what you want to know
    * (T) Learn by searching the internet
    * (P) Learn by practising repeatedly, especially coached practice
    * (P) Learn by conducting an experiment
    * (S) Learn by teaching someone else
    * (T) Learn by creating conceptual maps of relationships among items or ideas
    * (T) Learn about ideas by connecting them to what ou already know

* Five methods that I have never used but feel **excited** to try out:
    * (R) Learn by readin fiction or watching a movie
    * (P) Learn by expressing through movement and dance
    * (R) Learn by creating symbols
    * (T) Learn by thinking metaphorically: link the known to the unknown
    * (P) Learn by striving to achieve an ambitious goal

* Three methods that I have never used and feel **challenged** to try out:
    * (T) Learn from an online or distance education course
    * (R) Learn by teaching yourself
    * (P) Learn by dramatisation, by acting it out

What I did:
* Learn by searching the internet - About the Manzanares river
* Learn by striving to achieve an ambitious goal - Currently doing so by learning to dev in the shortest time possible
* Learn from an online or distance education course - Currently doing so by learning to dev using OpenClassrooms

## Define your learning strategy

**Learning plan**:
1. Select a strategic goal and define the field
2. Complete the colored columns with your strengths and weaknesses
3. Complete the colored rows with your opportunities and threats
4. Cross the columns and rows to determine the best learning tactics
5. Ask for the feedback of an outside observer, such as a colleague or friend


<br>


### Define your strategic goal

My strategic goal is **professional development** in **IT**.


<br>


### Analyze your strengths and weaknesses

My **strengths** are:
* Logical and mathematical thinking
* Autonomy and efficiency
* Interest in what I believe is useful to many


My **weaknesses** are:
* Project management
* Design thinking
* Lack of humility


<br>


### Identify your opportunities and threats

**Luck = opportunities + preparation**

My **opportunities** are:
* OenClassrooms courses / StackExchange habit / Lot of practice ahead
* Loads of job offers
* Free time to learn

**Bad luck = opportunities + lack of preparation**

My **threats** are:
* Lack of time
* Depression / bore-out
* Missed out opportunities such as job offers


<br>


### Prioritise your subjects of study

Here are my tactics:
* **Offensive tactics**:
    * Driven by my interest and motivation, screen job offers and get contact(s), opportunities, find what has the most impact
    * Thanks to my autonomy and efficiency, make the best out of the free time I have
    * Thanks to my logical and mathematical thinking, map everything I learn in online courses to my set of integrated and active knowledge
* **Defensive tactics**:
    * Leverage my interest in what I believe is useful to engage in job offers
    * Leverage my autonomy and efficiency to make the best out of the time I have
    * Rely on my mathematical and logical thinking to identify all issues and solution, preventing depression and boredom
* **Preventative tactics**:
    * Take advantage of projects proposed by online courses to get better at project management
    * Be less arrogant in considering all job opportunities
    * Exercise my design thinking to take advantage of my free time
* **Emergency tactics**:
    * Consider and watch every job opportunity and not be blinded by arrogance
    * Develop innovative and interesting projects, to work out design thinking and not let bore-out take the better of me
    * Manage my own project from start to end, devoting some time to it each day


Here are my priorities:
1. Develop innovative and interesting projects, to work out design thinking and not let bore-out take the better of me
2. Consider and watch every job opportunity and not be blinded by arrogance
3. Manage my own project from start to end, devoting some time to it each day
4. Exercise my design thinking to take advantage of my free time
