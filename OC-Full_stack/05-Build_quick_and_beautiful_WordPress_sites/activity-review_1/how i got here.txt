- first of all i had 3 pages in mind 
	1. the home page which is bascially a landing page where you'll find a cover/landing photo with a title on top
	2. the blogs pages - basically has blogs
	3. the contact us page which was to basically contain a login form
	4. i later changed my mind and discarded the contact page then added a page with info on typesetting.

- having all this on my mind i then chose the best theme that can handle all this content. I added the theme by searching for it ,installing it and activating it
- i then went on to customize the theme and also add few details like blogs
- i had to add a menu in order for the top navigation to appear
- i also had to add a footer using html via the text editor.
