http://dev-candcagency.pantheonsite.io/

If it isn't working then I took the screenshots. I couldn't fit the whole page in each shot so I tried to break them up into different
parts. The headers on some are cut off, but they each had a header on the top that is visible in some of the photos.

NOTE: The site I made is me practicing for the Wordpress project given in the Front-End Web Dev path for Premium Plus members.
	It involves having to make a site for a mountain real-estate agency called "Chalets and Caviar."


What did I change:

I chose the theme that I did because it had space for a large background image as the header and the theme made customizing quite easy. 

On the home page I chose a stock photo from a stock photo site and added it to the header's main image spot,
I also put a couple stock photos below in the content section with a list of random ski resort locations just to add some text.

The "Rentals" page looks a little nicer, I added a post about just put random text with another stock image. The sidebar has 
a photo and a text block as well.

On the "For Sale" page I tried to do the same as in the "Rentals" page but it didn't end up looking quite as nice. I couldn't
figure out why it aligned so well with a timestamp on the "Rentals" page but why not in the next. I hadn't done anything different
and the posts were done the same.

For the "Contact" page I installed a form-making plugin and through the plugin I made a contact form which is now embedded to the
"Contact" page.

In the footer, I added the calender to the left and some fake contact information to the right.

The custom CSS that I added involved the header text that says "Chalets and Caviar" on the main header backdrop image.
I increased the font-size in the media query to 3.5rem from 2.35rem. I also changed the font-family to "Garamond".
