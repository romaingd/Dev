Hello to you reader!

My name is Harry Roselmack, and I am new to the tech field and very excited about it.
Let's start with a couple lines on my personal background. I am a French journalist, 
mostly known for my work on radio and television. I studied History (and of course 
journalism), so this is a new adventure to me.

I unfortunately have no past tech experience to analyze, but what led me here is the
observation that journalists only have little knwoledge of how computers and the web
work, while it seemed of great importance to me. After some research, I got even more
interested and I am now considering reconversion to the tech field, because I believe
there are awesome techniques that could be used to bring formidable tools for everyone,
especially journalists.

For these reasons, I find myself rather attracted to the job of mobile developer, since
I am convinced that mobile applications are parts of tomorrow's swiss-knife (the mobile 
phone), and I'd like every one to be granted access to such powerful tools for their 
everyday life. I think my goal is to develop a couple of mobile apps on my own, to
leverage all the insights and understanding of the needs of non-tech people, in order
to maximize the impact I can have on today's society.

Cheers to that!
Harry
