Hello My friend,

Hope you are doing well!

So regarding this activity, I used a text editor to write the Main code (store.html/store.css/store.js), instead of CodePen. 

Furthermore, concerning the second HTML(Store-Products) & JSON(Name/Artist/Year/Tracks), I used CodePen to host the files.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards.
